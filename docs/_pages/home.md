## Welcome to my personal knowledge base

In this website/blog I intend to summarize the current state-of-the-art knowledge on several topics, mostly to learn and understand my gaps.

### Content

I will add what I keep learning such as which [human datasets](/docs/_posts/2021-03-02-Human datasets.md) containing neurons/astrocytes have been published.

[Down Syndrome](/_posts/2021-03-02-Down Syndrome.md)
[iPSC models of Down Syndrome](/_posts/2021-03-02-DS models.md)

### Comments

Comments and suggestions will be accepted, once I figure out how to implement that.
