Must undergo several steps of [[RNA-seq quality control]]

Sample preparation:

samples are tipicaly obtained from fresh samples and not fixed samples

Most [[Fixative methods]] are not useful since RNA can crosslink to proteins and therefore reduce data quality although there are **exceptions**.

## [RNA-seq methods](2021-03-04-RNA-seq-method%201.md)
There are multiple methods for preparation of RNA-seq data.

## [Published datasets](2021-03-04-Access-datasets.md)
Access to published raw and analyzed data is sometimes access restricted in case of human data (GDPR).

Data can be obtained from various number of species and tissues.
