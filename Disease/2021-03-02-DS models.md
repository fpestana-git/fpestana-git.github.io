# Down Syndrome models
Live human tissue is difficult to obtain due to ethical issues in extracting cells and tissues from live human brain tissue.

There are three main sources of Down Syndrome tissue:
- iPSC-derived cells;
- Fetal tissue
- Frozen tissue

### How to obtain isogenic controls
There are multiple ways to obtain isogenic controls for DS iPSCs:
- Genetic deletion for Chr 21 loss;
- Fibroblasts from mosaic individual;
- Inducible XIST inactivation of one Chr 21;
- Fibroblasts from dischordant twin pair;
