## Welcome to my personal knowledge base

In this website/blog I intend to summarize the current state-of-the-art knowledge on several topics, mostly to learn and understand my gaps.

### Content

Topics (mostly scientific) can be selected on the left sidebar.
I will add what I keep learning such as which [human datasets](/docs/2021-03-02-Human datasets.md) containing neurons/astrocytes have been published.

Others such as:
- [Down Syndrome](/docs/_posts/2021-03-02-Down Syndrome.md)
- [iPSC models of Down Syndrome](/docs/_posts/2021-03-02-DS models.md)

### Comments

Comments and suggestions will be accepted, once I figure out how to implement that, if it is even possible.
