## Welcome to my personal knowledge base

In this knowledge database I intend to explore the current state-of-the-art knowledge on several topics, mostly to learn and understand the gaps I have in my knowledge.

### General workflow
I am currently using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and github-pages

1) Clone repository into local disk.

2) In obsidian, selected the repository as vault

3) Using Zettelkasten plugin: automatic date (YYYY-MM-DD-this-is-a-note). I do not include spaces as to allow backlinking in both obsidian and github pages

4) Using github desktop: commit and push

### Content

Topics (mostly scientific) can be selected on the left sidebar.
Example of topics in progress:
- Published [human datasets](/RNA-seq/2021-03-02-Human-datasets.md) containing neurons/astrocytes.
- Quality control of RNA-seq data [rna seq quality](/RNA-seq/2021-03-04-RNA-seq-quality-control.md)
Others such as:
- [Down Syndrome](/Disease/2021-03-02-Down-Syndrome.md)
- [iPSC models of Down Syndrome](/Disease/2021-03-02-DS-models.md)



### Comments

Comments and suggestions will be accepted, once I figure out how to implement that, if it is even possible.
