# Welcome to my personal knowledge base

In this personal knowledge database I will compile information on resources such as methodologies and publically available datasets.

I will also include data analysis guides.

### Content

Some topics currently in progress:
- [RNA-seq human datasets](/RNA-seq/2021-03-02-Human-datasets.md)
- [Rna seq quality control](/RNA-seq/2021-03-04-RNA-seq-quality-control.md)
- [Down Syndrome](/Disease/2021-03-02-Down-Syndrome.md)
- [iPSC models of Down Syndrome](/Disease/2021-03-02-DS-models.md)



### General workflow
I am currently using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- Clone repository into local disk.
- In obsidian, selected the repository as vault
- Using Zettelkasten plugin: automatic date (YYYY-MM-DD-this-is-a-note). I do not include spaces as to allow backlinking in both obsidian and github pages
- Using github desktop: commit and push

### coding (Rmd files)
- Generate files with rstudio
- knit to .md file
- Save to github repository
- [Example](/coding/2021-03-04-test-coding.md)



### Comments

Comments and suggestions will be welcome, once I figure out how the best way to work that.
